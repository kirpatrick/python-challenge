Python scripts for analyzing the company employee data

# Project Overview - PyBoss
Create a Python script to convert employee record data to the required format.

### Given
Employee data; [*employee_data.csv*](https://github.com/kirpatrick/python-challenge/tree/master/ExtraContent/PyBoss/data). The dataset is composed of:
- Emp ID
- Name
- DOB
- SSN
- State

### Instructions / Functionality / Design
Help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required format.
The Name column should be split into separate First Name and - Last Name columns.
- The DOB data should be re-written into MM/DD/YYYY format.
- The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
- The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.
 
 ### Solution
1. Install the recommended version of Git and Python listed in the *Tech Stack* below.
2. Clone or download the [python-challenge repository](https://github.com/kirpatrick/python-challenge) to your computer.
3. Using Git Bash, navigate to the PyBoss directory.  This is where the main.py execution script is located.
4. Type the following command in the bash terminal prompt ($) to analyze the financial records:

    $ Python main.py

5. Analysis results will be printed to the terminal and saved to *'./data/formatted_employee_data.csv'*

<i>Links will be updated.</i>

# Project Overview - PyBank
Create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company.

### Given
Financial data; [*budget_data.csv*](https://github.com/kirpatrick/python-challenge/tree/master/PyBank/data). The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

### Instructions / Functionality / Design
Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

 Final script will print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
 
 ### Solution
1. Install the recommended version of Git and Python listed in the *Tech Stack* below.
2. Clone or download the [python-challenge repository](https://github.com/kirpatrick/python-challenge) to your computer.
3. Using Git Bash, navigate to the PyBank directory.  This is where the main.py execution script is located.
4. Type the following command in the bash terminal prompt ($) to analyze the financial records:

    $ Python main.py

5. Analysis results will be printed to the terminal and saved to *'./data/output.txt'*

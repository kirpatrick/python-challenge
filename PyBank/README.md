# Project Overview
## Python Activity I - PyBank
Create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company.

### Given
Financial data; [*budget_data.csv*](https://github.com/kirpatrick/python-challenge). The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

### Instructions / Functionality / Design
Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

 Final script will print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## Python Activity II - PyPoll
Create a Python script to analyze voting poll data.

### Given
Poll data; [*election_data.csv*](https://github.com/kirpatrick/python-challenge). Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

### Instructions / Functionality / Design

- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won

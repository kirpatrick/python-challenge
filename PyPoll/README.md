<i>Links will be updated.</i>

# Project Overview - PyPoll
Create a Python script to analyze voting poll data.

### Given
Poll data; [*election_data.csv*](https://github.com/kirpatrick/python-challenge/tree/master/PyPoll/data). Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

### Instructions / Functionality / Design
Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

 Final script will print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

### Solution
1. Install the recommended version of Git and Python listed in the *Tech Stack* below.
2. Clone or download the [python-challenge repository](https://github.com/kirpatrick/python-challenge) to your computer.
3. Using Git Bash, navigate to the PyPoll directory.  This is where the main.py execution script is located.
4. Type the following command in the bash terminal prompt ($) to analyze the election records:

    $ Python main.py

5. Analysis results will be printed to the terminal and saved to *'./data/output.txt'*
